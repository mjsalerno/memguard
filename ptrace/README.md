# Function hooking via ptrace
Description: This directory contains some sample code for running ptrace
## Settings up the project
### Pre-reqs
1. Linux OS
2. gcc is installed
3. make installed
  using ubuntu you can install gcc using sudo apt-get install gcc or on fedora sudo yum install gcc
### Instructions
Once all the prereqs are aquired just run 
```bash
make all
```
This script will build `sample`, `sample2` and the executable `hw`

Trying running
`sample2 sample` or `sample hw`

It should print out the number of instructions ran and the value of RIP(x64) (or EIP(x86))

```
